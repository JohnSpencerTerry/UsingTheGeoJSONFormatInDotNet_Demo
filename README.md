# Using the GeoJSON Format In .NET

GeoJSON is a geospatial variant of JSON that allows you to easily represent arrays of points, polygons, and other geometric objects. 

If you’re not familiar, I recommend a quick google search – it’s an easy to grasp, easy to read format that allows for dynamic use of geospatial data.

In this short demo, we’re looking at a few basic features of the format and the [GeoJSON.NET library](https://github.com/GeoJSON-Net/GeoJSON.Net) using a point in my local park as well as the dataset [StarbucksLocationsWorldwide.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnSpencerTerry/UsingTheGeoJSONFormatInDotNet_Demo/master/UsingTheGeoJSONFormatInDotNet_Demo/Resources/StarbucksLocationsWorldwide.csv)


Check out the [Program.cs](https://github.com/JohnSpencerTerry/UsingTheGeoJSONFormatInDotNet_Demo/blob/master/UsingTheGeoJSONFormatInDotNet_Demo/Program.cs) file to get started.
